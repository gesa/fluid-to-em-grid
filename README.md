# fluid-to-em-grid
================

I wanted a grid system that was fluid on smaller screens, but would be em-based for larger screens. Everyone has their limits on how wide their content can go and still make sense to the reader.

The class names are inspired by [Dryan's CSS Smart Grid](http://www.github.com/dryan/css-smart-grid) because frankly I think he did it right.
